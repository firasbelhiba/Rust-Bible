These are common question on the constants topic

### Question 1 : What is the difference between `static` and constant ?

In Rust, the main difference between a `static` variable and a `const` variable is their storage location and mutability.

`const` variables are stored in the read-only memory section of the program and are guaranteed to be immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed once set. They are declared using the `const` keyword and their value must be known at compile-time.

`static` variables, on the other hand, can be either mutable or immutable and are stored in a specific memory section called the data segment. They are declared using the static keyword and their value can be known at runtime.

Another difference is that `const` variables can be defined in any scope, while static variables can only be defined at the module level or inside an `impl` block.

In summary, `const` variables are immutable, stored in read-only memory, and their value must be known at compile-time. static variables can be mutable, stored in the data segment, and their value can be known at runtime.


### Question 2 : Can static variables be mutable on rust ?

Yes, `static` variables in Rust can be mutable. They are declared using the static keyword and can be marked as mutable using the `mut` keyword. For example, the following declares a mutable static variable named MY_VAR:

~~~bash  
static mut MY_VAR: i32 = 0;
~~~

Please note that `static` mutable variables have some restrictions, such as they can only be accessed within an unsafe block, and multiple threads cannot access it at the same time without proper synchronization, otherwise it will result in undefined behavior.

It's worth mentioning that most of the time, Rust developers prefer to use `RefCell` or `Mutex` to share mutable variables across threads and avoid the use of static mut variables.

### Question 3 : Why mutating a static variable is not safe ? 

if multiple threads access a mutable `static` variable without proper synchronization, it can result in data races and undefined behavior.

A data race occurs when two or more threads access the same memory location concurrently and at least one of the accesses is a write operation. Data races can result in unexpected or inconsistent behavior, such as unexpected values being written to the shared memory location.

Aliasing violations occur when multiple threads access the same memory location with different types or mutability. This can also result in undefined behavior, such as when a thread reads a value from a shared memory location while another thread writes to it.


### Question 4 : why does constant in rust has no address ?

In Rust, constants are stored in the read-only memory section of the program, rather than on the stack or heap. Because of this, they do not have a specific memory address that can be taken. Additionally, constants are guaranteed to be immutable, so it would not make sense to take their address, as it would not be possible to change the value stored at that address.
