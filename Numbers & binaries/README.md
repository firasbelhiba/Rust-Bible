## Representation of data  
 In computing, we care about storing and transferring data ( information )

There are different types of data we may want to transfer :
- Boolean ( true / false )
- Integers and decimal numbers 
- Text ( charachters and strings )
- Structured data ( JSON, XML, HTML, ... )
- Binary data ( images, proprietary format)
 
Programming languages help us work with these formats

## Types of computing  
Electronic systems fall into 2 categories: 
- Analogue systems use current to represent data : 
    - E.g, 4-20mA current loop 
- Digital systems use pulses to encode data : 
    - Communication using a stream of 0s and 1s 
    - Each piece of information ( either 0 or 1 ) is called a bit
    - We can store bits in memory ( RAM , SSD ) or transmit them
    
E.g Modern computers are primarily digital systems with some exceptions ( e.g , microphone , audio output, etc.)
